# User Profile

This file is a template. Personalize it during `engie init` or edit directly.
Your actual profile is stored in `~/.engie/profile/user.json`.

## Preferences
- Concise communication, no fluff
- Lead with blockers and risks
- Factual tone in all written artifacts (commits, PR descriptions, Jira comments)
- Write in first person: "Added support for X" not "We added support for X"

## Work Patterns
- Configure active hours in `engie init`
- Morning standup summaries delivered via your preferred channel
- Telegram for after-hours urgent alerts

## Organizations

### Primary Org
- **Role**: (your role)
- **GitHub org**: (your GitHub org)
- **Jira**: (your Jira instance URL)
- **Key projects**: (configured during setup)

## DevOps Context
- Add org-specific devops notes here as Engie learns your workflow
- Engie will auto-detect repo structures, branch conventions, and CI patterns
