"built":"Research document created at memory/openfang-research.md with full OpenFang architecture analysis. Identified 6 priority capabilities to port: Hands manifest system, knowledge graphs, CRAAP evaluation, skill pipeline, workflow engine, enhanced security. OpenFang installed at ~/.openfang/bin/openfang v0.2.3.",

"next":"Phase 3a: Build a Hands manifest system — define HAND.json schema, write a loader in brain/hands/, wire it into the brain system so autonomous tasks can be declared as manifests with schedules, tools, metrics, and multi-phase playbooks. Start with porting the Researcher and Collector Hand concepts to work with Familiar's existing tools."}

State persisted to state.json. CRAAP evaluation on Priority 2 (Knowledge Graphs): 4.6/5 — strongly recommended. Current RAG: 638 flat chunks, cosine similarity only. Gap: no entity extraction, no relationship mapping, no graph traversal. Plan: (1) brain/rag/graph.mjs — entities + relationships tables, LLM entity extraction, co-occurrence relationships, BFS traversal; (2) modify ingest.mjs to extract entities per chunk; (3) extend index.mjs with graphSearch() hybrid mode. Entity types: person, project, repo, task, tool, concept, org. Relationships via co-occurrence weight + typed patterns.",

Then wire into ingest.mjs and add graphSearch() to index.mjs. Test by running ingest on existing 638 chunks and verifying entity table population."}
