Identified 6 priority capabilities to port: Hands manifest system, knowledge graphs, CRAAP evaluation, skill pipeline, workflow engine, enhanced security. OpenFang installed at ~/.openfang/bin/openfang v0.2.3.","worked":"OpenFang binary installed and accessible. Research doc written and will be ingested into RAG at next learner cycle.","next":"Phase 3a: Build a Hands manifest system — define HAND.json schema, write a loader in brain/hands/, wire it into the brain system so autonomous tasks can be declared as manifests with schedules, tools, metrics, and multi-phase playbooks. Start with porting the Researcher and Collector Hand concepts to work with Familiar's existing tools."}
