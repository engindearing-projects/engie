Without it, rejecting the promise when `maxContentLength` is exceeded still leaves the underlying TCP stream open and buffering data.\n\n### `lib/adapters/http.js`\n\n**Before (0.18.0):**\n```javascript\nres.on('data', function handleResponseData(chunk) {\n  responseBuffer.push(chunk);\n\n  if (config.maxContentLength > -1 &&\n      responseBuffer.length > config.maxContentLength) {\n    reject(createError(\n      'maxContentLength size of ' + config.maxContentLength + ' exceeded',\n      config, null, lastRequest\n    ));\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**After (0.18.1):**\n```javascript\nres.on('data', function handleResponseData(chunk) {\n  responseBuffer.push(chunk);\n\n  if (config.maxContentLength > -1 &&\n      responseBuffer.length > config.maxContentLength) {\n    res.destroy();  // <-- the fix\n    reject(createError(\n      'maxContentLength size of ' + config.maxContentLength + ' exceeded',\n      config, null, lastRequest\n    ));\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Why it matters\n\n| Without fix | With fix |\n|---|---|\n| Promise rejects, but stream keeps emitting `data` events | `res.destroy()` closes the socket and stops data flow |\n| Data continues to be pushed into `responseBuffer` | Buffer is no longer populated after limit hit |\n| Memory can grow unbounded for large responses | Memory is bounded to `maxContentLength` |\n| Attacker can send an oversized payload to exhaust server memory | Payload is cut off at the limit |\n\n### Impact on `labs10-discussion-board`\n\nThis matters if the frontend makes any proxied/server-side `axios` calls with `maxContentLength` set, or if axios is used in a Node.js backend context. The upgrade in `/frontend/package.json` simply bumps the version:\n\n```json\n// package.json\n- \"axios\": \"0.18.0\"\n+ \"axios\": \"0.18.1\"\n```\n\nNo application code changes are needed \u2014 the fix is entirely within the axios library itself."}]}

I created a PR in the docs repo, as the automated process from the PR flow will help the ticket get reviewed and approved. For UD 140, the WEB development team wanted to verify that the changes that they were going to make for their ticket  UD 159 Database Redesign, wasn't going to have an effect on the DS API. The changes in question were rolled back migrations and deleting the overlapping migrations and their corresponding seed files. The BE verified that the remaining migrations run correctly along with the seed files. At this moment the DS API is stable and error free after the BE implementation.\r\n\r\n#### Video Link\r\n\r\n[Loom Video](https://www.loom.com/embed/b600cd3365c74ef8a4f9bcc4a63d20b6)\r\n\r\n#### Jira Link\r\n\r\n<https://bloomtechlabs.atlassian.net/browse/UD-140>\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [X] My design/diagram follows the style guidelines of this project\r\n- [X] My docs are organized within an appropriate folder structure in our repo\r\n- [X] Pull request description clearly describes docs made & motivations for said additions\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/023472e4f1a8449986c78e2bd4e10eba\n\nBased on this PR description, write the key code changes that would implement this.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n## What This PR Actually Is\n\n**PR #15 is a README.md update**, not a code change. It documents the outcome of a discovery/verification ticket, not an implementation.\n\n---\n\n## What the README.md Update Would Contain\n\nThe change likely adds a section like this to a relevant `README.md`:\n\n```markdown\n## DS API Stability Verification (UD-140)\n\n### Context\nThe BE team (UD-159 Database Redesign) performed the following changes:\n- Rolled back overlapping migrations\n- Deleted the rolled-back migration files and their corresponding seed files\n\n### Verification Result\n- Remaining migrations run correctly\n- Seed files execute without errors\n- DS API is **stable and error-free** after BE implementation\n\n### Related Tickets\n- [UD-140](https://bloomtechlabs.atlassian.net/browse/UD-140) \u2014 Discovery ticket\n- UD-159 \u2014 Database Redesign (BE team)\n```\n\n---\n\n## What the BE Changes Would Have Looked Like (UD-159)\n\nThe actual database work (in a separate repo) involved:\n\n```\n# Deleted files (overlapping migrations + seeds):\ndb/migrations/20220XXX_overlapping_migration.js  \u2190 deleted\ndb/seeds/20220XXX_overlapping_seed.js            \u2190 deleted\n\n# Rolled back via knex:\nknex migrate:rollback --to=<last_stable_migration>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nThis PR exists to satisfy a docs workflow requirement \u2014 the discovery ticket (UD-140) needed a PR in the docs repo to move through the review/approval pipeline. The actual technical work (migration cleanup) happened in the BE repo. **The file changed here is only `README.md`**, likely adding a status/findings section as shown above."}]}
