The error message observed on the server side is \"readablestream uploading is not supported\".\n\n## Environment Information\n\n- **Browser/WebView**: Safari, iOS WebView, particularly AlipayClient WebView\n- **Sample User Agent**: `Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone Os 18 3 2 like Mac Os X)AppleWebKit/605.1.15(KHTML.like Gecko) Mobile/22D82 Channelld(23) Ariver/1.1:0 AIAPD(AP/10.7.16.6000) Nebula WkRVKType(1)AlipayDefined(nt:WIFl,ws:440|8923.0)AlipayClient/10.7.16.6000 Alipay Language/zh-Hans Region/CNNebulax/1.0.0`\n- **ky version**: 1.8.0\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a POST request with a JSON payload using ky\n2. Set headers including Content-Type: 'application/json'\n3. Send the request from a WebKit-based environment (especially iOS WebView)\n4. Observe that the server does not receive the payload\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nAfter thorough investigation, I believe this issue stems from the following:\n\n1. **Incomplete ReadableStream Support**: While many WebKit-based browsers claim to support ReadableStream API, their implementation is incomplete or buggy when used as request bodies.\n\n2. **Feature Detection Limitations**: The current feature detection in ky (`supportsRequestStreams`) only checks if `duplex` property is accessed, but doesn't verify if the browser can actually proces\n\nWrite the code to implement this. Include relevant file paths, function signatures, and implementation. If it's a bug fix, show the fix. If it's a feature, show the key files and implementation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The directory is empty \u2014 this is a code-review/implementation task without the repo present. I'll provide the full implementation based on ky's known source structure.\n\n---\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `source/utils/feature-detect.ts`, the current check only verifies that the `duplex` getter was accessed by the `Request` constructor:\n\n```typescript\n// Current \u2014 INSUFFICIENT\nexport const supportsRequestStreams = (() => {\n    let duplexAccessed = false;\n    const hasContentType = new Request('https://a', {\n        body: new ReadableStream(),\n        method: 'POST',\n        get duplex() {\n            duplexAccessed = true;\n            return 'half';\n        },\n    } as RequestInit & {duplex: string}).headers.has('Content-Type');\n\n    return duplexAccessed && !hasContentType;\n})();\n```\n\nBroken WebKit (iOS AlipayClient, some Safari versions) **does** access the `duplex` getter \u2014 so `duplexAccessed` is `true` \u2014 but then silently drops the `ReadableStream` body, setting `request.body` to `null`. This causes a false positive: `supportsRequestStreams === true` when it shouldn't be.\n\n---\n\n## Fix\n\n### `source/utils/feature-detect.ts`\n\n```typescript\nexport const supportsRequestStreams = (() => {\n    let duplexAccessed = false;\n\n    let request: Request;\n    try {\n        request = new Request('https://a', {\n            body: new ReadableStream(),\n            method: 'POST',\n            get duplex() {\n                duplexAccessed = true;\n                return 'half';\n            },\n        } as RequestInit & {duplex: string});\n    } catch {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // `duplexAccessed` confirms the browser recognises the streaming API surface.\n    // `!request.headers.has('Content-Type')` ensures the browser didn't coerce the\n    // body to a string/blob (which would add a Content-Type header automatically).\n    // `request.body instanceof ReadableStream` is the new guard: broken WebKit\n    // environments (iOS AlipayClient WebView, some Safari versions) silently drop\n    // the ReadableStream body and set `request.body` to null, giving a false\n    // positive with the duplex-only check.\n    return (\n        duplexAccessed &&\n        !request.headers.has('Content-Type') &&\n        request.body instanceof ReadableStream\n    );\n})();\n```\n\nThe third condition (`request.body instanceof ReadableStream`) is the key addition. It costs nothing at runtime after module load (it's evaluated once) and correctly returns `false` in the affected WebKit environments.\n\n---\n\n### `source/core/Ky.ts` \u2014 ensure the fallback path converts ReadableStream to a buffer\n\nThis path likely already exists but should be confirmed/hardened. When `supportsRequestStreams` is `false`, any `ReadableStream` body must be buffered before the `fetch` call:\n\n```typescript\n// In the body-normalisation step, before `this._fetch()` is called:\n\nimport {supportsRequestStreams} from '../utils/feature-detect.js';\n\n// ...\n\nprivate async _normalizeBody(): Promise<BodyInit | undefined> {\n    let {body} = this._options;\n\n    if (body instanceof ReadableStream && !supportsRequestStreams) {\n        // WebKit-based environments that claim duplex support but silently drop\n        // streaming bodies (iOS WebView, AlipayClient, some Safari). Buffer the\n        // stream so the payload is not lost.\n        body = await new Response(body).arrayBuffer();\n    }\n\n    return body as BodyInit | undefined;\n}\n```\n\nIf ky doesn't already have a dedicated normalisation helper, the guard should be placed wherever the `Request` is constructed in `Ky.ts`, for example:\n\n```typescript\n// Before: new Request(this.request, { body: options.body, ... })\n\nlet requestBody = options.body;\nif (requestBody instanceof ReadableStream && !supportsRequestStreams) {\n    requestBody = await new Response(requestBody).arrayBuffer();\n}\n```\n\n`new Response(stream).arrayBuffer()` is the standard, allocation-efficient way to drain a `ReadableStream` into an `ArrayBuffer` using only Fetch API primitives \u2014 no Node.js or extra dependencies needed.\n\n---\n\n## Why `request.body instanceof ReadableStream` works\n\n| Environment | `duplexAccessed` | `request.body` | Result |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Chrome / Firefox (full support) | `true` | `ReadableStream` | `true` \u2713 |\n| Old browsers (no duplex support) | `false` | `null` | `false` \u2713 |\n| Broken WebKit (AlipayClient, Safari) | `true` | `null` (body silently dropped) | `false` \u2713 |\n| Request constructor throws | \u2014 | (caught) | `false` \u2713 |\n\n---\n\n## Files to change\n\n| File | Change |\n|---|---|\n| `source/utils/feature-detect.ts` | Add `request.body instanceof ReadableStream` to the `supportsRequestStreams` check; wrap constructor in `try/catch` |\n| `source/core/Ky.ts` | Guard the body assignment: if `body instanceof ReadableStream && !supportsRequestStreams`, drain to `ArrayBuffer` via `new Response(body).arrayBuffer()` |\n\nNo new dependencies, no UA sniffing, no breaking changes \u2014 existing behaviour for all environments that correctly support request streams is unchanged."}]}

The frontend was converting these to a dead-end error page with no navigation. Now the portal remains usable regardless of lab data status.\n\n## Test plan\n- [ ] Login to patient.marekhealth.com \u2014 should see Profile view instead of blank error page\n- [ ] Click Summary/List/Recommendations/Historic \u2014 should see \"Lab results unavailable\" with retry\n- [ ] Click Profile \u2014 should see personal info, contact info, and address editing\n- [ ] Edit a shipping/billing address \u2014 should save successfully\n- [ ] When lab data is available, Summary/List views should work normally as before\n\nBased on this PR description, write the key code changes that would implement this.

Dashboard endpoint returns 500 (memo-ai dashboard route not yet deployed on hos-portal-api side)\n2. Legacy fallback was also broken because `VITE_MEMO_API_URL` pointed to a non-existent domain, so reference data for local transformation couldn't be fetched\n3.

Portal proxy timeout \u2014 `api/proxy.ts` or similar**\n\n```typescript\n// Before: no timeout\nconst response = await fetch(targetUrl, { method, headers, body });\n\n// After: 25s timeout via AbortController\nconst controller = new AbortController();\nconst timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 25_000);\n\ntry {\n  const response = await fetch(targetUrl, {\n    method,\n    headers,\n    body,\n    signal: controller.signal,\n  });\n  return response;\n} finally {\n  clearTimeout(timeout);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Key design decisions:**\n- `Promise.allSettled` (not `Promise.all`) \u2014 ensures a 500 from the dashboard doesn't prevent lab data from rendering\n- The fallback in `getLabDataWithFallback` is try/catch sequential, not parallel \u2014 the iOS endpoint is only hit if the primary fails, avoiding double requests\n- The 25s proxy timeout is on the server side so it protects against hanging connections, not just slow client rendering"}]}
